    "In the Introduction, we used the q2.specpars module to calculate iron_stats for a fixed set of parameters. Now we can use it to solve for better parameters (\"better\" here means consistent with 1D-LTE excitation/ionization equilibrium).\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to define some parameters for the solution procedure. As usual, starting from the input Teff, logg, and vt, q<sup>2</sup> will try to find those values that minimize the slopes of iron abundance versus line EP and REW as well as match the average FeI and FeII abundances. This is an iterative procedure. We can set the initial steps for the changes to be applied to those parameters (step_teff, step_logg, etc.) using a SolvePars object. Also, it is a good idea to set a maximum number of iterations (niter) in case q<sup>2</sup> is not able to converge quickly (or at all). At this point we can also set the model atmosphere grid we want to use. In this example we are using MARCS models again.\n",
